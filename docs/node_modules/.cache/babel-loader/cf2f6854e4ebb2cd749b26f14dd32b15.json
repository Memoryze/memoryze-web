Except for a claim by Memoryze against you, any and all disputes between you and Memoryze arising under or related in any way to these Terms must be resolved through binding arbitration as described in this Section. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly. It includes, but is not limited to, all claims and disputes relating to your use of the App.&nbsp;<br /><br />b. YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND MEMORYZE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Section. For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is N3,000,000 or less, the AAA, you and Memoryze must abide by the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions; and (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. If the claim exceeds N3,000,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA rules, and the hearing (if any) must take place in Lagos, Nigeria. The arbitrator’s ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event this agreement to arbitrate is held unenforceable by a court, then the disputes that would otherwise have been arbitrated shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in Lagos. Claims of infringement or misappropriation of Company’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall be exclusively brought in the state and federal courts located in Lagos, Nigeria.&nbsp;<br /><br />d. The laws of the State of Lagos, excluding its conflicts of laws rules that would result in the laws of a State other than Lagos, govern this license and your use of the Service.</span>\n\t\t\t</p><p class=\"c5 c7\"><span class=\"c10\"></span></p><p class=\"c4\"><span class=\"c0\">e.
